Rock Paper Scissors is a simple and fun game where you compete against the computer. Choose between Rock (👊), Paper (🫱), or Scissors (✌️), and the computer will randomly select its choice. The winner is determined by the classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors (👊 > ✌️)
Scissors beat Paper (✌️ > 🫱)
Paper beats Rock (🫱 > 👊)
If both players choose the same option, it’s a tie!
The game features animated results and a responsive design, making it enjoyable on both desktop and mobile devices. Try your luck and see if you can beat the computer! 🚀
